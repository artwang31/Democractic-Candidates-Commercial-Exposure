# Democractic-Candidates-Commercial-Exposure

Imported, wrangled, and tidied a dataset that documented all Democratic Candidates' commercial exposure.

Then created a visualization detailing the commercial airtime and exposure of the leading Democratic candidates
from December 30, 2018 to September 30, 2019. 

The visualization indicates which candidates receive the most exposure from three different cable news outlets: CNN, MSNBC, and FOX news.
